# Folder / File Listing Tool

A Windows batch script that lists the contents of a specified directory, including folders and files, and optionally saves the listing to a text file.

## Features

- Prompts the user to enter a directory path.
- Validates that the path exists.
- Separately displays folders and files in the specified directory.
- Offers the option to save the listing to `files_list.txt`.
- Loops back after completion to allow repeated use.

## Usage

1. Run the batch script (`.bat` file).
2. Enter the full path of the folder you want to inspect.
3. View the folders and files displayed in the console.
4. Choose whether to save the listing to `files_list.txt` by entering `Y` or `N`.
5. The script returns to the start for another directory input.
6. `files_list.txt` will be saved in the same directory from which you run the batch script.
